# Machine Learning Based Intrusion Detection System for CAN Bus
This repository contains the code for a Two Stage Intrusion Detection System, that uses both hard-coded rules along with a neural network in order to determine if a packet sent on a CAN bus is malicious or not.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository. If Git is installed, then run `git clone https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/linxiz/IDS-18-Fall.git`.
1. Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Using a higher version of Python will not work: you must use this version of Python. You will also need pip installed with Python: this is done by default.
1. Run the command `pip install .[test]`. This will install all dependencies that this project requires in order for you to run it.
1. Run the command `pytest`. This will automatically perform all unit tests, and you can verify that all tests pass.
